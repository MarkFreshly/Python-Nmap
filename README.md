# Python-Nmap

Just made a straight foward python script that uses https://github.com/nmmapper/python3-nmap (this is needed) to do nmap scans. I made this
just to automate the most common nmap commands I use on TryHackMe boxes. Also could be used for an initial scan in Red Teaming.

To run this put nmmapper/python3-nmap  and this script in the same folder. Run my script, put in the IP address you wish to scan,
then select the scan option. It will then show the completed scan in json and create json txt file with the same info. Then either do 
another scan or exit.
